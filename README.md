# Elevator-Logic
An animated Python elevator simulation designed to pick up passengers and take them to their destinations. 

#Instructions:
Click on the buttons (i.e. 1UP, 2UP, 2DOWN etc.) to queue a passenger on the respective floor going in the specified direction. Passengers will automatically select a destination. If the elevator is idle for 60 seconds, it will return to the ground floor. 

#Concepts Used:
- Python List Data Structure
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Pygame
